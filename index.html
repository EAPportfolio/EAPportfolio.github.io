  	<h2>Design with an eye towards children's literature.</h2>
  
		<p id = "welcome">Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I am a creative professional with a passion for literature and storytelling. With a solid foundation in the Adobe Suite, I have experience in Dreamweaver, Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. My journey into the world of design has been fueled by an interest in children's literature. I find joy and inspiration in creating stories and layouts that captivate young minds!</p>
  
  		<p>I strive to create visually engaging content that not only meets the needs of clients but also leaves an impact on the hearts of young readers. I look forward to collaborating on projects that celebrate both the magic of design and the wonder of childhood.</p>

	<p> My name is Emily Porter, and I am so excited to meet you. Over the last 5 years, I have worked with children in many capacities--they are my favorite! I so enjoy their creativity and the way that they fully embrace life.</p>
		
		<p>I graduated BYU-Idaho with an English bachelor's degree in 2024, and am purusing a career in language and storytelling. I would love to work as a content designer for programs catering to children, as an editor specializing in picture books, or as a children's librarian. Recently, I served on my college's board for the National Association for the Education of Young Children, which was a wonderful opportunity to design content and events that taught about child development. </p>
		
		<p> When not in school or working, I love to read, cook, and take care of my lovely plants.</p>

            <h3><a href="Project 1 - AI Halloween.pdf">AI Halloween CandyLand</a></h3>
            <p> As part of a collaborative team of 3 other students, I created cover art, text, and character images for an imaginary new version of CandyLand. We used various AI programs, including Firefly, NightCafe, OpenArt, ArtFlow, and ChatGPT. This experience not only provided hands-on exposure to exciting new AI tools, but also allowed me to actively contribute to the creative process. Working alongside my peers, I engaged with these diverse AI programs to bring our vision to life, demonstrating my adaptability and teamwork skills in a professional setting. This project not only expanded my technical capabilities but also highlighted the importance of effective collaboration in achieving shared goals. </p>

            <h3><a href="Book Swap Booklet (Final).pdf">InDesign Book Swap Pamphlet</a></h3>
            <p>As a collaborative team, we joined forces to design a pamphlet for an upcoming BYU-Idaho student book swap. Our goal was to effectively communicate information such as the event's location, schedule, and featured book selections. Leveraging InDesign, we crafted the layout for each page of the pamphlet, ensuring a visually appealing and informative presentation. This experience deepened my proficiency in utilizing tools like InDesign and taught me fundamental design principles such as colors, white space, and the use of images.</p>

            <h3><a href="cover banner-combined.pdf">Photoshop Poster Series</a></h3>
			<p>I developed a captivating series of four posters using Photoshop. These photos, intended for display in a private or public library, feature iconic storybook characters along with the phrase “Books make us…brave, creative, and smart.” Besides simply developing the posters, this project served as a platform for me to delve into the realm of graphic design. Through the process, I honed my Photoshop skills and designed visually engaging posters that convey the power of books.</p>

            <h3><a href="Page & Parcel Branding Package (1).pdf">Illustrator Logo and Branding Package</a></h3>
            <p>Using Illustrator, I crafted a distinctive logo and comprehensive branding package for a small business specializing in thrifted book boxes. The branding materials, from color schemes to typography, were thoughtfully chosen to convey the business's identity cohesively. This project not only allowed me to showcase my skills in graphic design but also provided valuable insights into the strategic thinking required for effective branding. Through the use of Illustrator, I honed my ability to create visually compelling and memorable brand elements that resonate with the ethos of the thrifted book box business.</p>
